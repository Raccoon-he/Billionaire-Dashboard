# Billionaire Dashboard - Reflection

### What have implemented:

- The dashboard highlights the youngest, wealthiest, and oldest billionaires, as well as the top industry among them.
- We've completed a global map that shows the number of billionaires per country. It defaults to showing the total number of billionaires worldwide.
- A pie chart illustrates the distribution of industries by the final wealth of billionaires.
- A line graph displays the final wealth of billionaires across different age groups.
- Clicking on a country on the map联动（interacts） with other charts to show relevant data for that country.

### Why some not yet implemented

Due to time constraints, we haven't implemented a ranked bar chart for the top 10 companies by billionaire wealth or a demographic chart showing the distribution of billionaire age and gender.

### Something not working in dashboard

The map currently shows the global total of billionaires but fails to revert to this view when clicking on ocean areas or countries without billionaires.

### What dashboard does well

- The dashboard effectively uses various visualizations like maps, line graphs, and pie charts to represent data.
- The map quickly conveys geographical distribution trends of billionaires.
- Color coding aids in distinguishing between different categories or values.
- The pie chart provides a quick snapshot of wealth distribution across industries.

### What needs to be improved

- The map needs further development to display more detailed geographical information and to revert to the global total when clicking on ocean areas.
- The layout of the pie chart requires adjustment for better aesthetics.


### General Concerns

- Is the dashboard intuitive and easy to navigate for users unfamiliar with data visualization?
- Will the dashboard layout change across different browsers?
- Could configuration errors occur on different users' computers?
